1. Build the siddhi-gpl-execution-streamingml from the /github.com/wso2-extensions and copy the jar into {WSO2SPHome}/lib

2. Copy {WSO2SPHome}/samples/artifacts/0048/AMRules-Regressor-sample.siddhi to {WSO2SPHome}/wso2/worker/deployment/siddhi-files

3. Copy {WSO2SPHome}/samples/artifacts/0048/trainRegressor.json and testRegressor.json to {WSO2SPHome}/wso2/worker/deployment/simulation-configs

4. Copy {WSO2SPHome}/samples/artifacts/0048/train.csv and test.csv to {WSO2SPHome}/wso2/worker/deployment/csv-files

5. Start the worker using ./{WSO2SPHome}/bin/worker.sh

6. Run the following curl command to simulate regression with events in train.csv and test.csv
	curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/simulation/feed/trainRegressor/?action=run

    curl -X POST http://localhost:9090/simulation/feed/testRegressor/?action=run

7. See the output in the WSO2SP terminal
